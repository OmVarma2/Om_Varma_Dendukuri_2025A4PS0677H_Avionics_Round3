I have only done the first task out of the three.
This is my solution to task 1 of the third round of JANUS.

I explained how the code works with comments in the code itself!

the way i have wired the Quectel L89HA GNSS module to the arduino board is as follows:-

Quectel L89HA GNSS---Arduino
VCC---3.3 V (The voltage from the arduino is 5v we have to reduce it by using voltage dividers and resistors to 3.3v or else the device will get spoilt)
GND---GND
TXD---Arduino RX 8th pin 
RXD---Arduino TX 7th pin

The code reads the NMEA data transmitted from Quectel L89HA GNSS to the ardunio breaks it into its constituent values and returns it on the serial.

Thnak you!
